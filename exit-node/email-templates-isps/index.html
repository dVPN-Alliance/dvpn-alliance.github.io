<h2>Email to ISP to educate on distributed networks and your participation in them</h2>
<p>To whom it may concern,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am writing to you to inform you that I am running a node within a distributed virtual private network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That means that I am routing anonymized, encrypted traffic from a decentralized VPN Network to the Internet without processing or filtering using the following IP: [your IP address].&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralized VPN Networks protects users against global issues such as censorship, identity theft, and online harassment. This is the main reason for my participation in this network. </p>
<p>I understand that not all ISPs look positively at node running activities, and am reaching out to explain the value of these types of networks. I hope, as an organization committed to protecting the privacy of its customers, you'll agree that this is a valuable and relevant technology.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in more information on distributed VPNs, you can check out the following resources:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mysterium.network/2019/12/03/geoblocking-its-impact-on-free-speech-to-free-movies-online/">What is geoblocking, and how does it affect free speech online.&nbsp;</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mysterium.network/2019/09/18/the-splinternet-is-coming-and-why-decentralization-can-stitch-it-back-together-again/">What is a VPN connection, and why is decentralisation important?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As a loyal customer, I hope to see [insert ISP name] join <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/GoodBadISPs">the list of ISPs supporting distributed systems</a> that are committed to furthering the human condition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,&nbsp;</p>
<p>[your name]</p>
